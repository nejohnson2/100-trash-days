# 100 Days of Trash

This project was inspired by Katherine Dillon and her [Reflections on 100 Days of Making](https://itp.nyu.edu/adjacent/issue-1/blog/2017/08/06/reflections-on-my-100-days-of-making/).  This project aims to create a unique analysis of trash data for the next 100 days.  The ground rules are:

1. *Identify a theme and create a unique and self-contained iteration every day for 100 days*
2. *Document the effort daily publishing social evidence of it*

Thank you Katherine.
